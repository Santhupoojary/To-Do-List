To-Do List App:
A simple, responsive web-based To-Do List application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This app allows users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete or incomplete. The tasks are stored in the browser's local storage, so they persist across sessions even after refreshing the page or closing the browser.
